# Farming Practices Dashboard

This is a simple dashboard I built, using collapsible trees, that explores the differences in farming practices in the United States as reported by the USDA Census and the USDA ARMS Survey. As a member of a research team, my job was to aid the task of selecting the most useful dependent variables for the models being built. Given the scope of both the USDA Census and the Survey, I wanted to present the differences between the relevant variables in the clearest possible way for the rest of the team to understand what they were dealing with. 

The dashboard is hosted here: https://ant-onio.shinyapps.io/Practices/

### Note: When using the dashboard, open the Census tab by clicking on "Explore" and let the tree load before anything else, and then proceed to use the dashboard freely. This delay is an issue with the collapsible tree HTML widget that I hadn't figured out yet.
