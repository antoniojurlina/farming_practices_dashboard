# Farming Practices Dashboard

This is a simple dashboard I built, using collapsible trees, that explores the differences in farming practices in the United States as reported by the USDA Census and the USDA ARMS Survey. As a member of a research team, my job was to aid the task of selecting the most useful dependent variables for the models being built. Given the scope of both the USDA Census and the Survey, I wanted to present the differences between the relevant variables in the clearest possible way for the rest of the team to understand what they were dealing with.
